{-| This module implements the `flatMap` combinator for `Maybe`.  This allows you to call functions
that return a `Maybe` with arguments that are also `Maybe`s without having to worry about ending up
with a `Maybe (Maybe a)` return type.

For example:

    getHeadFromMaybeList : Maybe List -> Maybe a
    getHeadFromMaybeList =
      flatMap List.head
